# Online-Learning_RVFL
OLedRVFL and ODEWTedRVFL codes on UCI datasets.


These codes are done to replicate "Online learning using deep random vector functional link network" and "Online dynamic ensemble deep random vector functional link neural network for forecasting" by Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan.
This was done as part of the Summer Internship 2025 at IIT Indore under Prof. M. Tanveer.
